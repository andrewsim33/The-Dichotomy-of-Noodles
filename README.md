# The Wonders of An Amalgamation of Dough and Broth #

Noodles have been a staple of cuisine around the globe for thousands of years. Noodles have been said to have originated from China in the early third century and in its earliest form looked like chunks and bits of dough rather than the long thin strands that have been normalized today. Noodles come in all sorts of interpretations and forms but the one thing that remains consistent about all of them is their dynamic taste. Whether cold or hot, wet or dry, you can always expect a veyr pleasant experience. Apart from their immaculate taste noodles provide to the consumer a medicine unlike any other. Apparent to all that have tried them,  noodles can transport you into another realm of warmth and affection. Personally, I have garnered many memories from eating noodles. The history and love embedded into each individual noodle combine with one another to create a masterpiece in a bowl of noodles that can be enjoyable with anyone and everyone.

## The Wide Horizon of Possibilty ##

Specifically, noodles can be seperated into two main categories; hot and cold. While some would argue that noodles should be characterized by whether or not they have soup accompanying them or not I believe that this should not be the case. While the soup is a huge part of a noodle dish, the temperature can shift the entire dynamic of the dish. For example a warm noodle dish can inhibit feelings such as comfort, warmth, and family. Remember the times where you would lay sick in bed from a raging cold? A warm bowl of chicken noodle soup could have lifted your spirits and made you feel as if you had the whole world supporting you and your body against your fight against. On the other hand a cold noodle dish such as, Nangmyeon, which is a Korean noodle dish consisting of long and thin handmade noodles made from the flour and starch of various ingredients, including buckwheat, sweet potatoes, arrowroot starch, and kudzu, can seriously cool down ones body when times are tumultuos or when the weather is hot. The parallel of cold and hot noodles are very apparent but at the end of the day they are brothers. Two different sides of the same coin, both of these types of noodles will have you feeling full and satisfied.
